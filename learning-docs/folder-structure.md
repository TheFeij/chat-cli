Go projects follow a **minimalist but strongly opinionated** convention:

> *“Package boundaries define responsibilities.”*

Unlike Java or Python, Go discourages large frameworks and encourages clean, dependency-driven layering. The structure you showed is built to:

-   Make code **modular** and **testable**

-   Prevent **cross-layer dependency leaks**

-   Facilitate **reusability** and **encapsulation**


---

## 📁 Folder-by-Folder Breakdown

### 1\. `cmd/`

**Purpose:** Entry points for binaries.

Each subfolder under `cmd/` corresponds to one **executable** your repo produces.

Example:

```bash
cmd/server/main.go
cmd/migrator/main.go
cmd/worker/main.go
```

In your case:

-   `cmd/server/main.go` is the **main** for your microservice.

-   It wires everything together (routes, config, logging, etc.).

-   It should **not** contain business logic.


> Think of `cmd/` as your *composition root* — where the application is assembled.

---

### 2\. `internal/`

**Purpose:** Private application logic.

Go enforces the `internal/` rule — any package inside `internal` **cannot be imported** by code outside the module.  
That prevents accidental misuse by other projects.

You typically split it like this:

| Subfolder | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **handler/** | Handles HTTP requests, decodes/encodes data, calls services |
| **service/** | Core business logic; rules, validation, orchestration |
| **repository/** | Deals with persistence (database, cache, filesystem) |

These layers depend downward only:  
`handler → service → repository`

Not the other way around.

> This ensures **separation of concerns** and **testable units**.

---

### 3\. `pkg/`

**Purpose:** Public reusable packages.

Anything inside `pkg/` is meant to be **importable by external modules** (or by multiple internal modules).  
It contains generic, non-domain-specific components.

In your example:

```bash
pkg/models/
```

would contain **shared data types** or **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** — e.g.:

```go
// pkg/models/user.go
package models

type User struct {
    ID    int64  `json:"id"`
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email"`
}
```

These structs might be:

-   Used in both `handler` and `repository`

-   Serialized to JSON

-   Returned to external services


> Think of `pkg/` as your **shared library** — stable, versionable, and importable.

---

### 4\. `go.mod` / `go.sum`

-   `go.mod` defines your module name and dependencies.

-   `go.sum` locks dependency versions.


These files ensure **dependency reproducibility** — similar to `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.

---

## 🧱 Why This Structure Is “Standard”

| Reason | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Encapsulation** | `internal/` prevents unintentional coupling between microservices. |
| **Clarity** | `cmd/` clearly shows entry points; `pkg/` holds reusable parts. |
| **Maintainability** | Changes in one layer (e.g., DB schema) don’t ripple across handlers. |
| **Testability** | Each layer can be tested independently using Go interfaces. |
| **Scalability** | As microservice grows, you can add new submodules cleanly (`auth`, `payment`, etc.). |

### 🧩 Visual Dependency Flow

```pgsql
+-------------+
        |   cmd/      |   (wires everything)
        +-------------+
               ↓
        +-------------+
        | internal/handler |   (presentation)
        +-------------+
               ↓
        +-------------+
        | internal/service |   (business logic)
        +-------------+
               ↓
        +-------------+
        | internal/repository | (data access)
        +-------------+
               ↓
        +-------------+
        | pkg/models |  (shared types)
        +-------------+
```

Each layer depends only on the one below it, keeping the system **clean and acyclic**.

## 🧠 In Short

| Folder | Visibility | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cmd/` | executable entry | app startup and wiring |
| `internal/` | private | app logic and layers |
| `pkg/` | public | shared reusable code |
| `go.mod` / `go.sum` | \- | dependency management |
